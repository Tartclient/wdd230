                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                    Seattle was originally inhabited by Indigenous people for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers.
                    In 1851, the first European settlers arrived in Seattle and established a townsite. The town grew rapidly due to its location as a port city, and by the 1880s, it was one of the largest cities on the West Coast.
                    Seattle's economy was originally based on the timber and fishing industries, but it later grew to include shipbuilding, manufacturing, and technology. Companies like Boeing, Amazon, and Microsoft are all based in the Seattle area.
                    Seattle played an important role in the Civil Rights Movement, with local activists fighting for desegregation and equal rights for people of color. The city also played a key role in the labor movement, with workers organizing for better working conditions and higher wages.
